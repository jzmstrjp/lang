# Configure your preferred Terraform backend here.
# Example for Terraform Cloud:
#
# terraform {
#   cloud {
#     organization = "your-org"
#
#     workspaces {
#       name = "lang-app-dev"
#     }
#   }
# }
#
# Alternatively, use S3 or another backend. This file intentionally keeps
# the backend configuration commented out so you can supply credentials
# without committing secrets.
